# üìö CodeTitans: The Clash of the Algorithms

Welcome to **CodeTitans**, a structured and rigorous 8-week journey through **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your fundamentals, this project provides deep theoretical insights and extensive hands-on problem-solving using curated problems from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.

> ‚ÄúThe foundation of every great developer lies in mastering algorithms and data structures.‚Äù
